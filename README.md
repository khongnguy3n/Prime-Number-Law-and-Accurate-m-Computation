# Prime Number Law and Accurate Prime Counting

This research introduces a structural and recursive law governing the distribution of prime numbers. Based on this law, we propose a deterministic method to compute the prime-counting function π(m) with high accuracy.

## Key Concepts

- Recursive construction of integer sets X(n), R(n), and A(n)
- Prime identification through multiplicative filters
- A consistent and repeatable pattern forming a prime number law

## Contributions

- Discovery of a fundamental structural law of primes
- A clear, testable method to compute π(m) without probabilistic models
- New theoretical insights into the distribution of prime numbers
